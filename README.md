### Annotation
The aim of the thesis is to collect data about microclimate throughout the year in  classrooms and lecture halls. Discussed are potential impacts of temperature, relative humidity, light intensity and concentration of carbon dioxide on comfort and focus of students. Devices, such as thermohygroscope, luxmeter and carbon dioxide sensor, with the help of data loggers, were being used to collect data during lectures. Data are summarized and analyzed and so is the significance of variables such as size of rooms, ventilation, crowdedness and weather.

Cílem práce je nasbírat data o mikroklimatu učeben a přednáškových sálech v průběhu roku. Zhodnocen je vliv teploty, relativní vlhkosti, intenzity světla a koncentrace oxidu uhličitého na komfort a pozornost studentů. Ke sběru dat byly použity přístroje jako thermohygroskop, luxmeter a senzor oxidu uhličitého společně s data loggery. Data jsou analyzována a sumarizována a také je zhodnocen vliv proměnných jako velikost místností, ventilace, počet přítomných osob a venkovní počasí.

### Aim/Introduction
The aim of the thesis is to collect data about microclimate throughout the year in  classrooms and lecture halls. Discussed are potential impacts of temperature, relative humidity, light intensity and concentration of carbon dioxide on comfort and focus of students. Devices, such as thermohygroscope, luxmeter and carbon dioxide sensor, with the help of data loggers, were being used to collect data during lectures. Data are summarized and analyzed and so is the significance of variables such as size of rooms, ventilation, crowdedness and weather.

 Interest in indoor air quality and thermal comfort has been on the rise in the last years. People of western countries spend more than 85% of their time indoors (NHAPS, 2001). 
### Methodology & scope of measurements
#### Devices used
D3121 Thermo-hygrometer was used to collect temperature and relative humidity values. Accuracy of measurement of the device is ±0.4°C for temperature and 2.5% for relative humidity. The device comes with a data logger that has been set to log values in two minutes intervals.
Telaire 7001 CO2 / Temperature monitor was used to collect carbon dioxide concentration values in parts per million units. Accuracy of measurement of the device is ±50 ppm. We collected the measured values manually at ten minute intervals.
Vernier light sensor together with Go!Link USB sensor interface for collecting light intensity values in lux units. The device has to be connected to a computer with Logger Pro software running to collect data. We have used custom made tripod to consistently collect data under the same angle - so the sensor is always perpendicular to the ground. The device was set to collect values in the 0-600 range and therefore the resolution was 0.1 lux.
#### Data collection process
The author of the thesis was carrying all the previously mentioned devices with him on the lectures he was attending. Sensors were placed on the table ranging from X to Y high consistently at the same place, usually in the middle of the room to avoid the influence of windows, be it bright light or ventilation and to accurately document average microclimate conditions in the room.  All the sensors were turned on at the official time of start of the lecture. At that point relevant information about the condition of the room was documented: whether lights were being turned on or off, number of people present in the room, outside weather conditions, if doors or windows were opened and if any object blocked the light from outside. Temperature and relative humidity were being logged with the help of a data logger in 2 minute intervals. Light intensity values were being logged in 1 minute intervals and carbon dioxide concentrations were being logged manually at 10 minute intervals.
Any significant events during the data collection time were being documented. Those usually were: people arriving and leaving, window and doors opening and closing, turning off and on lighting.
