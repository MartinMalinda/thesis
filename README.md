### Aim/Introduction
The aim of the thesis is to collect data about microclimate throughout the year in  classrooms and lecture halls. Discussed are potential impacts of temperature, relative humidity, light intensity and concentration of carbon dioxide on comfort and focus of students. Devices, such as thermohygroscope, luxmeter and carbon dioxide sensor, with the help of data loggers, were being used to collect data during lectures. Data are summarized and analyzed and so is the significance of variables such as size of rooms, ventilation, crowdedness and weather.

 Interest in indoor air quality and thermal comfort has been on the rise in the last years. People of western countries spend more than 85% of their time indoors (NHAPS, 2001). 
 
### Methodology & scope of measurements
#### Devices used
D3121 Thermo-hygrometer was used to collect temperature and relative humidity values. Accuracy of measurement of the device is ±0.4°C for temperature and 2.5% for relative humidity. The device comes with a data logger that has been set to log values in two minutes intervals.
Telaire 7001 CO2 / Temperature monitor was used to collect carbon dioxide concentration values in parts per million units. Accuracy of measurement of the device is ±50 ppm. We collected the measured values manually at ten minute intervals.
Vernier light sensor together with Go!Link USB sensor interface for collecting light intensity values in lux units. The device has to be connected to a computer with Logger Pro software running to collect data. We have used custom made tripod to consistently collect data under the same angle - so the sensor is always perpendicular to the ground. The device was set to collect values in the 0-600 range and therefore the resolution was 0.1 lux.

#### Data collection process
The author of the thesis was carrying all the previously mentioned devices with him on the lectures he was attending. Sensors were placed on the table ranging from X to Y high consistently at the same place, usually in the middle of the room to avoid the influence of windows, be it bright light or ventilation and to accurately document average microclimate conditions in the room.  All the sensors were turned on at the official time of start of the lecture. At that point relevant information about the condition of the room was documented: whether lights were being turned on or off, number of people present in the room, outside weather conditions, if doors or windows were opened and if any object blocked the light from outside. Temperature and relative humidity were being logged with the help of a data logger in 2 minute intervals. Light intensity values were being logged in 1 minute intervals and carbon dioxide concentrations were being logged manually at 10 minute intervals.
Any significant events during the data collection time were being documented. Those usually were: people arriving and leaving, window and doors opening and closing, turning off and on lighting.

##Illumination

Illumination is an important factor that may influence performance, alertness and well-being of students. It can play an important role on both psychological and biochemical level.

###Effects of illumination on human body

Most significant effect of light on the human body is probably it's influence on circadian rhythm. Light is a main driver for circadian rhythm and it can offset or shift the start of the circadian phase.

Light's ability to increase alertness has been confirmed in various studies both subjectively and objectively. There has been reports of increased thalamic activity (Vandewalle et al, Duffy et al), reduction of EEG activity (Duffy et al) and supression of melatonin (Duffy et al). Light can also lower cortisol levels, but mostly in the beginning of the biological day. (Jung et al) That is relevant, because cortisol can impair retrieval of long-term spatial memory (de Quervain et al). That could have adverse effect on learning which depends on recalling previous knowledge.

Another important factor is frequence of light. Higher frequencies are likely to have higher melatonin supression effect - In a 2009 study subjects after 6.5 hours of exposure report higher levels of alertness, better reaction times and and fewer lapses of attention. (Duffy et al)

In a 2014 study, 28 students were being observed under two lightning conditions: 200 lx and 1000 lx. They performed go no go tasks when they were relaxed and also after induction of mental fatigue. After the fatigue induction, the results were significantly better at 1000 lx and subjects also reported better mood. At a relaxed state, subjects preferred dim light (200 lx). (Smolders et al)

##Temperature
###Thermal comfort
Connection between mental performance and thermal comfort has been studied consistently in previous decades. A lot of studies focus on workers in industrial workplaces and observe workers deep body temperatures, environment temperature and it's effect on frequency of mistakes, productivity and other factors of performance. These studies generally discuss the effects of temperatures over 30C and the physiology of heat stress which is often not relevant to the school environment, but some results could apply. They find that simple tasks are less vulnerable to heat stress than complex tasks (Hancock [ROK]) and also that females can better withstand the negative effect of heat stress than males at tasks based on short-term memory (Hancock? [ROK]).

Heat stress occurs when body temperature is elevated due if body cannot sufficiently cool itself. This in workplace environment happens generally at temperatures 29.4C or higher (Hancock). We haven't recorded such high temperatures in our measurements, but they can be common in other countries. For example, during April and May in 2014 in large educational halls in Egypt, the temperatures ranged between 30C and 37C. Majority of students reported discomfort caused by high temperature, inadequate ventilation and sunlight. (Abdallah)

Later studies start to examine the effect of only mildly elevated temperatures on performance, which is relevant to school and office environments. In studies from 2003, Sepannen et al find a performance decreasing effect of 2% per a degree of temperature in the range of 25 - 32C (Sepannen et al., 2003). Later on, the performance decreasing effect has been observed to start at 23C and higher. (Sepannen et al. [ROK]). A lot of subsequent studies confirm the 24C to be critical point.([Sources]).

Most of the studies observe the short term effect of temperature on performance and they do not observe how temperature affect mood and energy levels of subjects throghout the whole day.

####Introduction

Carbon dioxide is not a typical indoor pollutant but yet there are quite a few commonalities with the classical pollutants. The main difference is, that the source of this pollutant in the indoor environment are people themselves. Carbon dioxide is generated by cellular respiration as a waste product of Krebs cycle. Another sources indoors might be other living organisms (plants, pets) and combustion processes - fireplaces, heat stoves, open fires etc.
Just like typical pollutants, CO2 can cause acute as well as chronic toxicity. Singificant health risks are possible only by exposure to very high concetration levels, but even mildly elevated concentrations (less than 2000 ppm) that are very common in indoor environments can already have a significant negative impact. This is especially important due to a reason, that people in western countries spend up to 90% of their time indoors.

##Generation and regulation of CO2 in organisms

Carbon dioxide generation occurs naturally during cellular respiration. Glucose is being broken down into pyruvate which enters the Krebs cycle and is further broken down. During those reactions there is a waste carbon, that is quickly oxidized into carbon dioxide which releases energy that is quickly used to form ATP in oxidative phosphorylation. 
(Biology: Supplemental resources, openstax college 2015)

The generation of CO2 is therefore never-ceasing and the speed of production is proportional to speed of metabolism. At rest, average human produces roughly 200 miligrams per hour. (NASA 2012) Carbon dioxide is transported in blood where it bonds to red blood cells. It is often transformed to carbonic acid or hydrogen carbonate ion. The concentration always tends to rise and the body needs to do continuous effort to get rid of it. That is in practice done by gas diffusion in pulmonary alveoli in lungs. Even though difussion might be quite slow process, it is effective as a whole, because pulmonary alveoli in an adult can have as much as 75 m<sup>2</sup> of surface.
(Openstax)

Carbon dioxide has an important role in the whole gas exchange process and in homeostasis. It acts as lewis acid and it forms carbonic acid and hydrogen carbonate ion with water. (Mohammad Abolhassani et al. 2008)

CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O ⟺ H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>⟺ H<sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>

This reaction is a very significant source of hydrogen ions and therefore greatly affects blood pH level. If for some reason the respiratory system is not working correctly, carbon dioxide can accumulate in blood which results in acidosis. (Abolhassani)

Contrentations levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen are the main factors for intensity of spontanious breathing. Carbon dioxide stimulates chemoreceptors in the brain stem directly and also indirectly by altering the blood pH level. Excitation of these chemoreceptors causes changes in spontaneous breathing patterns. And that supports the homeostasis. When the blood pH levels is decreased, breathing becomes stronger and carbon dioxide exits the body at a faster rate. If the blood is alkaline, the breathing tends te bo very slow or not active at all. Thus the blood pH level tends to stay around the value of 7,36. (Nattie) During common conditions, the carbon dioxide has much higher impact on breathing patterns than blood oxygen levels.

####Acute toxicity

Just like the carbon dioxide can diffuse from blood to alveoli, the external CO2 can diffuse into blood. The higher concentration levels of carbon dioxide are, the harder it is for the body to get rid of the excessive CO2 and to sustain a stable blood pH level. If the blood fails to stay alkaline, overabundant H+ ions are getting bonded to hemoglobin molecules. Intensity of breathing is increasing quickly. If the acidosis stays for longer period of time kidneys start to excrete hydrogen carbonate ionts from the blood. (Salt Creek Phases 2006)

Higher blood CO2 concentrations also lead to elevated blood pressure and cerebral blood flow. That can cause headaches or in worse cases loss of consciousness and death.(Salt Creek Phases 2006)

-- TABLE FOR ACUTE TOXICITY SYMPTOMS

####Long-term exposure to elevated CO2 concentrations levels

People in western countries are exposed to slightly elevated CO2 levels on daily basis for most of their lives. Even the pollutant is not as toxic as other pollutants, it's impact on life quality is high due to long durations of exposure. In last couple of years, there has been multiple studies on the negative impact of low concentrations levels. Even though physical symptoms manifest only at very high concentrations levels, any elevation is harmful to the human body. (Ezraty et al., Abolhassani et al.)

At low concentrations the main way how the CO2 affects the body is by decreasing the blood pH level. Changes in pH can have a great effect on speed rates of many biochemical processes and it can, among other things, lead to oxidative stress and inflammation. Intracellular oxidative stress has been documented for example on neutrophil granulocytes, where the pH had great influence on the production rate of IL-8 protein, which plays an important role in chemotaxis and inflammatory processes. (Coakley et al.) Especially strong inflammatory effect has been observed in the respiratory system, where exists a connection between CO2 concentration level and amounts of several types of cytokines. (Abolhassani et al.) Harmful effect of very low CO2 concentrations has been documented in vitro on E.coli, in particular it's ability to increase toxicity of H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species (HO•, O2•-). It affects the Fenton reactions as so:

H2O2 + Fe2+ ⟹ HO• + HO- + Fe3+ 

Hydroxyl radicals can afterwards react with CO2 metabolites: 

HCO3- + HO• ⟹ CO3•- + H2O 

CO32- + HO• ⟹ CO3•- + HO- 

Even though this carbonate radical has lower oxidative potential than ROS it can, however, in some reactions be a more effective oxidation agent than ROS (e. g. oxidation of some amino acids derivates). These reactions have been tested in vitro, where they have been observed as fluorescent lesis of DNA. The frequency of the lesis  as well as mortality significantly increased with the increase of CO2 concentrations. Th$e effect was much more outstanding after artifical increase of H2O2 concentration.(Ezraty et al.) 

####Impact on cognitive performance
Cognitive performance under influence of elevated CO2 has been studied several times in the last few years. In a study from 2013, 22 students were placed into an exposure chamber. CO2 concentrations levels in this chamber were artificially stabilized on predefined values. Students spend two and a half hours while working on the SMS test (Strategic Management Simulation). This was repeated three times. Sequence of concentration levels were randomized and every time there also was a different version of the test. Results can be seen here:
(Fisk et al.)

The results strongly suggest, that the concentration levels of CO2 have great impact on cognitive performance of exposed subjects. On the other hand, the study should probably be replicated with higher amount of subjects, test versions and repeats to rule out other potential variables (differences in test difficulty, mood and fatigue of subjects etc.)

Another study from 2015 was constructed a bit differently. It observed 24 employees over the period of one week in a controlled setting of office space. For two days, the air conditioning was set on 40 cfm per person and the CO2 level was stabilized on 550 ppm (Green+ mode). For next two days, air conditioning was set to 20 cfm/p and CO2 concentrations level was stabilized on 945 ppm (Green mode). For the remaining three days, CO2 was stabilized on 1400 ppm. The observed subjects completed the SMS test (Strategic Management Simulation) every day and the results were put in comparison. In average, the resuls were 61% better in the Green mode day and 101% better in the Green+ mode day. In some parts of the test there were as much as 288% better results on Green+ mode day. 
(Allen et al.)
Compared to the previous study, there is much higher duration of exposure which is closer to the real life situation, when subjects spend whole day in a certain indoor environment. On the other hand, there are again quite a few factors that could have had great impact. Even though it was probably carbon dioxide that had the largest impact on cognitive performance, because the concentration level was regulated by air exchange, that means that not only CO2 concentrations levels were different on different modes, but also VOC, NOx, Ozone and other pollutants. And also it could be possible to argue, that there is a natural trend of performance decrease in a workweek from Monday to Friday as the fatigue increases.

Study from 2002, which documented length of phone calls in a call centre, there was no observed connection between ventilation and work performance.
(Federspiel et al.)

###Concentration levels in various public spaces & reccomended values

Reccomended values and limits tend to differ in various countries of the world. Most of the states of the american continent accepted the standards from ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers). ASHRAE standard states that sufficient ventilation should keep the concentration level below 1000 ppm. European standard EN 13779 disects indoor environment into four categories: IDA 1, IDA 2, IDA 3 and IDA 4. For every category there are different limits nad reccomendations as it can be seen in Figure 2.
(Petty)

**Figure 2 - Reccomended liits of CO<sub>2</sub> for public space by standard EN 13779** (EC Standard for Ventilation)
| Category | Concentration difference of CO<sub>2</sub> (ppm) from outside levels | | 
|----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|
|          |**Typical range (ppm)**                               | **Initial value (ppm)** |
| IDA 1    | ≤ 400                                       | 350           |
| IDA 2    | 400 – 600                                   | 500           |
| IDA 3    | 600 – 1000                                    | 800          |
| IDA 4    | \>1000                                        | 1200         | 

Levels of concentrations of CO2 vastly differ in various types of indoor environments. They tend to be lower in new buildings, especially in public buildings and office spaces. Office spaces also more frequently tend to have air conditioning and a smaller amount of people per unit square then schools or libraries. Especially in smaller classrooms the concentrations tend to rise dramatically through the day in winter months. Many studies report as high concentrations as 5000 ppm. 
Study evaluating indoor environment in Danish school observed much high concentrations in schools built before 1950 (median: 1700 ppm) than at new schools build after 2000 (median: 1000 ppm). Statistically lower concentrations were also at mechanically ventilated buildings (medina: 1000 ppm) than at manually ventilated schools (1600 ppm). Same trend was observed in similar study in Athens, where mechanically ventilated schools had a median of 910 ppm, while manually ventilated schools were at 1410 ppm. 

There is much less studies on the air quality in large lecture halls and other large spaces. In six large lecture halls in Egypt with occupancy ranging from 26 to 120 the concentration did not reach over 1000 ppm (Abdallah). In a cinema hall in Poland with 230 occupants the concentration level raised from 920 ppm to 1219 ppm during a 159 minute film (Demaniuk et al). On the University of Melbourne, once lecture hall with 100 occupants was observed for 1 hour and 50 minutes. Three sensors were installed, one below, one in the center and one in the back of the hall. Highest concentrations - 900 ppm - were measured in the back of the hall, where the sensor (and also the occupants) was in highest position. After a period of time, the concentrations stabilized in the whole hall on 600 ppm - 800 ppm. In a more modern lecture hall with 30 occupants, the concentrations levelled from 400 - 800 ppm and highest values were again measured in the back of the hall. (Halgamuge et al.)

###Concentration of CO2 throughout the year

The results clearly indicate, that CO2 levels tend to be higher in the winter. Median for 38 measured lectures in winter semester (September - December) is 1258 ppm, while for measured lectures in summer semester (15 measurements during April and May), the median is 872 ppm. Median for all 53 lectures is 1060 ppm.

To illustrate, that the change is not caused just by the change of occupancy, we introduce a variable that takes into account both occupancy and CO2 levels. The occupancy/CO2 factor is defined like this:

F = (CO2(Measured) - CO2(Ambient))/N(Amount of people present)

This factor has been computed for every lecture. Ambient level for CO2 has been set as 400[TBD], which is an approx. average measured value on Mauna Loa observatory for year 2015. This value works as a baseline, even though the actual ambient levels tend to be higher in cities.

The factor was 36 ppm for summer semester and 42 ppm for winter semester and it can be read as such: in average one occupant caused increase of 42 ppm in CO2 levels. This difference still isn't that great, but if we split the datasets into small classrooms and large lecture halls, the results are more clear. For smaller classroooms, average factor is 43 ppm for summer semester and 51 ppm for winter semester. This clearly indicates that ventilation rates tend to be lower in cold months. This to some level correlate with indoor and outdoor temperature. Because in most measured places all ventilation was done manually, it was determined by occupants behavior and occupants tend to ventilate less if the indoor or even outdoor temperature is low.
