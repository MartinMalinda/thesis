(Smolders et. al)

- Results showed that illuminance level had a significant effect on
positive affect with participants reporting more positive affect in
the 1000 lx condition than in the 200 lx (at the eye) condition,
regardless of their prior mental state or time in session. This contrasts
the state-dependent effects of exposure to a higher illuminance
level on subjective sleepiness and self-control capacity as
well as the duration-dependent effect on sustained attention,
allowing us to discard positive affect as the underlying mechanism
for the alerting effects reported here. Moreover, the fact that participants
reported a higher positive affect in the 1000 lx condition
also indicates that participants did not perform better on the GoNoGo
task and 2-Back task in the 200 lx condition due to a more
positive mood.

- Subjective evaluations of the lighting revealed that the participants
rated the two lighting conditions differently. They experienced
the 1000 lx (at the eye) condition as more bright and
activating, regardless of their prior mental state. The 1000 lx condition
was also experienced as less pleasant and less adequate for
working when participants were more relaxed, but not when persons
suffered from mental fatigue and resource depletion.
In contrast, fatigued participants had a more positive attitude towards
working in a comparable environment with brighter light. These
results suggest that persons may appreciate a higher illuminance
level more e or at least not less e than regular office lighting when
they suffer from mental fatigue. These appraisals can therefore also
not explain why both fatigued and rested participants performed
better on the cognitive performance tasks in the 200 lx (at the eye)
condition.

(Jung et al)

- In the current study, we found that exposure to ∼10,000 lux of bright light on the rising and descending phases of the cortisol rhythm (i.e., when cortisol levels are high) decreased cortisol levels in humans. 

- The finding that bright light exposure reduced cortisol levels on the descending phase of the cortisol rhythm suggests that exposure to morning sunlight may have a greater effect on adrenal cortex physiology than previously recognized.

- During the afternoon, between ∼1200 and 1600 h when cortisol levels are relatively low, exposure to light intensities of 4500 to 5000 lux has consistently been reported to have no significant influence on cortisol levels.

- Exposure to bright light on the rising phase of the cortisol rhythm significantly decreased cortisol levels when compared to exposure to dim light the day prior

(Duffy et al)

-  Responses to monochromatic light of 460nm and 555nm of equal photon density were compared, and we observed that both phase-shifting and melatonin suppression were significantly greater in the subjects exposed to 460nm light than to those who received 555nm light. We also found that during the 6.5-hour light exposure, subjects exposed to the 460nm light rated themselves as significantly more alert, showed faster reaction times and fewer lapses of attention, and showed less EEG delta power and more EEG high alpha power than subjects exposed to 555nm light, consistent with a greater alerting effect of the short wavelength light

- In the 1-pulse study in young adults, we also examined the relationship between illuminance and measures of alertness, and found that brighter light had greater effects on subjective and objective measures of alertness

- We also found that when humans are exposed to a light stimulus in the late biological day/early biological night, that stimulus produces a phase delay shift (a shift to a later hour), and light stimuli presented in the late biological night/early biological day produce phase advance shifts (shifts to an earlier hour).
