"We have earlier developed (Seppänen et al. 2003) a relation between performance and temperature. It showed a decrease in performance by 2% per oC increase of the temperature in the range of 25-32 oC, and no effect on performance in temperature ange of 21-25 oC"

"Performance increases with temeperature up to 21-22C, and that performance decreases with temperature above 23 - 24C."

"The interpolation is that an increase of temperature up to 21 is associated with a statistically significant improvement in performance and an increase of temperature above 24C is associated with a statistically significant decrease in performance. This result is in a close agreement with out earlier conclusion reporting the no-effect temperature range being 21-25C."

"The field studies show a consistent decrease in performance in tasks typical of office work when temperature increease above 24-26C. The tasks in the reviewed studie are quire simple, and it is not clear how well the data apply to performance in actual office environments. However, as the reviewed studies include different specific tasks, the developed weighted relation may well represent average work in the office and may be applicable in man office environments."

"Data suggest that the effect of the temperature may be stronger in actual work than in short-term laboratory expreriments where the motivation may weaken the effect of the temperature."

"Students spend up to one third of the day in educational facilites"

From the survey: sources of uncomfortable feeling come from low wind speed (22%), high indoor surface temperature (24.3%) and the penetration of solar radiation (11.3%)

Indoor temperature ranged between 30 - 37 C. (24. 4. - 20.5. 2014)

Heat stress affects cognitive performance differentially, based on the type of cognitive task. Also, it appears that a relationship can be established between the effects of heat stress and deep body temperature.

Clear correlation has been found between het stress and worker unsafe behaviour. Unsafe work behaviour was minimal at 17 - 23C WBGT.

Females can better withstand the negative effects of heat stress than males when short-term memory is required.

A state in which the external thermal load is not intense enough to cause an elevation of the observers deep body temperature. In this state, vigilace performance remains essentially unaffected. In general, the upper limit of environmental exposure which induces no change in deep body temperature of the individial is 29.4C. This heat stress level coincides with Lind's upper limit of "prescriptive zone" and the upper limit of the zone of "thermal equilibration".

Grether suggested that time estimatin and reaction time is sped up upon exposure to heat due to an increased speed of neural conduction asociated with elevated body temperature.

Simple tasks are less vulnerable to heat stress than more complex tasks

Arousal theory has been used most extensively in the literature to explain the effects of heat stres on cognitive performance.

As arousal increases toward an optimal level, the quality of the performance improves. Beyond the optimal level, at which performance is best, performance gradually declises as arousal continues to increase.

According to Provins, more arousing tasks present performance decrements at lower temperatures than less arousing tasks.

Alternative: Maximal Adaptability Model assumes that heat exerts its detrimental effects on performance by competing for and eventually draining attentional resources.
